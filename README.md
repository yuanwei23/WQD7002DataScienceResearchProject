Prediction on Usability, Affect and User Value for "Brand Owner" Mobile Apps - A Machine Learning Approach
This repository houses the data science research project for the course code WQD7002, undertaken by a Master of Data Science student named Kam Yuan Wei (Matric ID S2158054). 
The project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of User Experience (UX) in mobile applications, emphasizing the viewpoint of brand owners. 
Utilizing Machine Learning Classification Algorithms, the research aims to predict and enhance UX based on dimensions such as usability, user affect, and user value. 
The code includes data preprocessing, exploration, machine learning model implementation, and visualization of results. 
Feel free to explore the project, and contributions or suggestions for improvement are welcome.
